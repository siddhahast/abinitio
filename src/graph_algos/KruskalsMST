On an edge weighted graph, a minimum spanning tree is a graphical interconnection between nodes, so that
the sum of the edge weights is less than any other tree.


Algorithm :
    Motivation : Need to stop creating cycles in the graph/tree.

    Process:
        1. enqueue all the edges of a graph and put them on a priority queue based on their weights.
        2. Create a Union find DS that will test whether two nodes are interconnected or not.
        3. Dequeue the edges individually and find out the vertices/nodes.
        4. Test whether the nodes are connected or not.
        5. If they are connected then ignore it.
        6. Else union the two nodes and mark them connected(path compression technique).
        7. Add the edge to the mst queue. Ideally create a mst queue of edges.

    Testing the connection of nodes (via the union path compression algorithm prevents cretion of cycles).

        If we select the edge (via iteration ) where both the ends are part of the tree,
    then they will have the same connected components.
